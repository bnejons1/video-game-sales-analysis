# Video Game Sales Analysis (2006–2010)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes video game sales data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zahidmughal2343/video-games-sale?resource=download and focuses on the peak sales years (2006–2010).  
The goal is to identify sales trends by platform, game, and year during this period.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Data Filtering)
- Kaggle (for dataset source)

## Key Analysis
- Filtered dataset to years **2006–2010** (peak sales period)
- Compared **yearly sales totals** to identify trends
- Compared **platform sales per year** to see market share shifts

## Key Findings

- **2008** marked the highest total sales volume

- Nintendo platforms (**Wii, DS**) dominated most years until the **Xbox 360 and PS3** gained significant traction

- Sales began to decline after 2009, suggesting **market saturation** before the next console generation.
- The **console release timeline** could explain this peak over the years. The triple punch of the Xbox 360 (2005), Wii (2006), and PS3(2006) collectively contribute to the sores in sales.

## Next Steps
- Expand analysis to include **genre trends** or **regional sales differences**
- Expand analysis to pinpoint other **console releases** PS4(2013), Xbox 1(2013)
